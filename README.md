### ‚ú® Story

The first version of `MegaRun` was developed using the `Unity` game engine, where the scripting language of choice was `C#`. The app relied on the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file for its core logic. Despite its obfuscated function names filled with random "A"s, moders found it relatively easy to manipulate. They took advantage of this simplicity, modifying the original app to unlock various _"abilities"_. However, these modified versions quickly spread, leading to unintended consequences. The app was terminated due to the widespread misuse of these mods, marking an abrupt end to the original `MegaRun`.

In response, _"the app owner"_ decided to give a second chance its users. But this time with enhanced security measures. The new version, known as `WOW`, was developed in `React Native` with the `Hermes` engine, making it considerably harder to reverse engineer. This updated framework presented significant obstacles for those who attempted to modify it. But as with any challenge, those with enough creativity and persistence would inevitably find ways to push the boundaries.

When I began this project, it was purely for fun and educational purposes. However, as I delved deeper, I found that achieving my desired results became increasingly difficult. Weeks passed without clear direction, but the more challenging it became, the more obsessed I grew with finding a solution. Despite the frustration, each setback fuelled my determination to explore, to test, and to break through barriers that seemed unbreakable. The journey itself became the reward, a relentless pursuit of understanding and mastery.

My purpose in publishing this repository is to offer some comfort to those on similar journeys, grappling with the same obstacles. If you possess the strength, skills, and determination, you‚Äôll uncover the missing pieces of this puzzle on your own. I won‚Äôt be providing hints or guidance, as I fear this app could meet the same fate as its predecessor. _The journey may be challenging, but for those willing to persist, the answers await_.
